# Weather Map Application

This project involves creating a web application called `WeatherMap` that utilizes HTML, CSS, jQuery, and the OpenWeatherMap API to display current weather conditions and a five-day forecast for a specified city. The application also integrates Mapbox API to allow users to drop a pin on any location on the map, retrieve coordinates, and update the weather forecast accordingly.
